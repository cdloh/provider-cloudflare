        description: Ruleset is the Schema for the Rulesets API. The Cloudflare Ruleset
          Engine https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/cf-rulesets allows you
          to create and deploy rules and rulesets. The engine syntax, inspired by
          the Wireshark Display Filter language, is the same syntax used in custom
          Firewall Rules. Cloudflare uses the Ruleset Engine in different products,
          allowing you to configure several products using the same basic syntax.

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
