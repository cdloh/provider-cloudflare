                  holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception of Identifier

                  creation, for example because of an external controller is managing
                  them, like an autoscaler.

                  managed and external resources. This field is planned to replace
                  the DeletionPolicy field in a future release. Currently, both could
                  be set independently and non-default values would be honored if
                  the feature flag is enabled. If both are custom, the DeletionPolicy
