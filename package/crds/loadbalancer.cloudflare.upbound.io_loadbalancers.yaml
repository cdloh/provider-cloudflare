        description: LoadBalancer is the Schema for the LoadBalancers API. Provides
          a Cloudflare Load Balancer resource. This sits in front of a number of defined
          pools of origins and provides various options for geographically-aware load
          balancing. Note that the load balancing feature must be enabled in your
          Cloudflare account before you can use this resource.

                  WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace and name of a
                  Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should
                  be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,
                  and password required to connect to the managed resource.
                  This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in favor of
                  PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both could be set independently
                  and connection details would be published to both without affecting
                  each other.

Subsequent requests, by the same client to the same load balancer, will be sent to the origin server the cookie encodes, for the duration of the cookie and as long as the origin server remains healthy. If the cookie has expired or the origin server is unhealthy then a new origin server is calculated and used. Value ip_cookie behaves the same as cookie except the initial origin selection is stable and based on the client's IP address. Available values: "", none, cookie, ip_cookie. Defaults to none.
