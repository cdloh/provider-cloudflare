        description: FallbackDomain is the Schema for the FallbackDomains API. Provides
          a Cloudflare Fallback Domain resource. Fallback domains are used to ignore
          DNS requests to a given list of domains. These DNS requests will be passed
          back to other DNS servers configured on existing network interfaces on the
          device.

                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
