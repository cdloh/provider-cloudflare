With value cookie, on the first request to a proxied load balancer, a cookie is generated, encoding information of which origin the request will be forwarded to. Subsequent requests, by the same client to the same load balancer, will be sent to the origin server the cookie encodes, for the duration of the cookie and as long as the origin server remains healthy. If the cookie has expired or the origin server is unhealthy then a new origin server is calculated and used. Value ip_cookie behaves the same as cookie except the initial origin selection is stable and based on the client''s IP address. Available values: "", none, cookie, ip_cookie. Defaults to none.'

            status_code: (Number) The HTTP status code used for this fixed response.
            steering_policy: '(String) The method the load balancer uses to determine the route to your origin. Value off uses default_pool_ids. Value geo uses pop_pools/country_pools/region_pools. For non-proxied requests, the country for country_pools is determined by location_strategy. Value random selects a pool randomly. Value dynamic_latency uses round trip time to select the closest pool in default_pool_ids (requires pool health checks). Value proximity uses the pools'' latitude and longitude to select the closest pool using the Cloudflare PoP location for proxied requests or the location determined by location_strategy for non-proxied requests. Value "" maps to geo if you use pop_pools/country_pools/region_pools otherwise off. Available values: off, geo, dynamic_latency, random, proximity, "" Defaults to "".'

            ttl: (Number) Time to live (TTL) of the DNS entry for the IP address returned by this load balancer. This cannot be set for proxied load balancers. Defaults to 30. Conflicts with proxied.
            zero_downtime_failover: '(String) Configures the zero-downtime failover between origins within a pool when session affinity is enabled. Value none means no failover takes place for sessions pinned to the origin. Value temporary means traffic will be sent to another other healthy origin until the originally pinned origin is available; note that this can potentially result in heavy origin flapping. Value sticky means the session affinity cookie is updated and subsequent requests are sent to the new origin. This feature is currently incompatible with Argo, Tiered Cache, and Bandwidth Alliance. Available values: none, temporary, sticky.'
            zone_id: (String) The zone ID to add the load balancer to. Modifying this attribute will force creation of a new resource.
